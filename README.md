#Dashboards
In this repository.I have created cricket player dashboards in which i collected data of individual player from different websites of cricket such as espncricinfo , cricbuzz etc.

I performed data formatting , processing , cleaning  using python libraries such as numpy and pandas.

And then i visualize the data using POWER BI as an dashboard.

Technologies Used:
Python (Data Processing)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
POWER BI (Data Visualization)
POWER BI (Interactive Dashboard)
